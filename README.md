**Abstract of the paper:**      
Social network influence maximization (SNIM) problem is a vital optimization
problem in the field of network science. In this paper, we compare the performances
of two heuristic algorithms (HAs), and two genetic algorithms (GAs) on the SNIM
problem. The two HAs are equipped with propagation-cost marginal benefit and
PageRank heuristic factors, respectively, while the GAs are equipped with different
elitist preservation strategies. Then, in the experiment, we use the independent
cascade (IC) model as the dynamics, and run the algorithms in Erdos-Rényi random
networks and Barabási-Albertmodel scale-free networks with node sizes of 200
and 600. Through the experiment, we find the propagation-cost marginal benefit
heuristic is better than the PageRank heuristic, GAs have obvious advantages over
HAs, while the elitist preservation strategy in GAs has no obvious effect.
